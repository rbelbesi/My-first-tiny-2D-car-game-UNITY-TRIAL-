# 🚗 Delivery Driver Game (Unity 2D)

A beginner-friendly Unity 2D project where players control a car to pick up and deliver packages across a simple map. Built while following the **Unity Game Developer 2D** course on **Udemy (Updated to Unity 6)**, this game is designed to introduce essential game development concepts using C# and Unity.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

The **Delivery Driver** project is a 2D top-down driving game. Players navigate a vehicle through a town to collect and deliver packages while avoiding obstacles and using speed boosts.

---

## 🧩 Game Features

* **Car Movement**

  * Top-down driving controls: move forward/backward and turn left/right.
  * Speed variations based on terrain or power-ups.

* **Package Pickup & Delivery**

  * Pick up a package by driving over it.
  * Deliver to a customer by reaching the destination area.

* **Visual Feedback**

  * Car changes color to indicate package status (e.g., red = carrying package).

* **Collision Handling**

  * Bumping into objects slows the car down, encouraging careful driving.

* **Expandable Design**

  * Easily add more features like different package types, customer colors, time limits, etc.

---

## 🎮 Game Design Concepts

* **Mockup-Based Planning**
  Early designs use simple shapes (cubes and circles) to block out gameplay before adding art.

* **Asset Management**

  * Assets imported and scaled using **Pixels Per Unit (PPU)** for consistent visual proportions.

* **Core Mechanics**

  * Speed boosts
  * Obstacles
  * Interactive delivery zones

* **Player Experience Focus**

  * Built to be engaging, intuitive, and satisfying with instant feedback for player actions.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

* Working with Unity 6 and 2D game physics
* Writing clean, modular C# code
* Implementing triggers and collisions
* Using tags to manage game object behavior
* Managing asset scaling and resolution
* Creating simple but effective gameplay loops

---

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the project in **Unity 6.0.0 or later**
3. Open `SampleScene` from the `Assets/Scenes` folder
4. Hit **Play** to test the game!

---

## 📁 Assets Used

* All assets used are provided by the course and licensed for educational use.
* Sprites include car, road tiles, buildings, and UI elements.

---

## 💡 Ideas for Expansion

* Add a **timer** for bonus delivery scores.
* Include **enemy cars** or random events.
* Implement **fuel mechanics** or **lives** system.
* Create a **level system** with increasing difficulty.
